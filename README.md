Fusio CLI
====================

# About

Fusio is an open source API management platform which helps to build and manage 
RESTful APIs. This repository contains the Fusio CLI client. More information
about Fusio at https://www.fusio-project.org/

This client is also a great inspiration if you need to build a CLI tool for your
API. The Model folder contains all automatically generated models. The command
then simply transforms the incoming data in such a model and sends it to the
API. To access the API you need to login through the login command which requests
an access token for the provided username and password.
